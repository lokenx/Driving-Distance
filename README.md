# Driving-Distance

Small proof of concept app to keep track of distances driven during the day.

My first attempt at integrating user accounts and collection publish/subscribe in the app. Allows users to easily calculate and keep track of distances travelled between various buildings on campus. Demo is available at ddist.meteor.com
